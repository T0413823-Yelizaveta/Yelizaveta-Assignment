**Chapter 1. Getting Ready for the Party**

The clock on her phone read 18:45. There was just over an hour left before the party, and she had plenty of time to get ready. She stood in front of the mirror in her room, contemplating which look to choose. The atmosphere was calm, but thoughts about how the evening would go were already swirling in her mind. Her boyfriend would be there, her ex as well, and of course, her best friend. But for some reason, a slight unease was growing. (Anxiety: 10%)

She sifted through her wardrobe. A tight black dress or a loose shirt with jeans? The decision could influence how people perceived her at the party. She decides...

**Key moment:**

1. Wear the tight black dress,adding a touch of bright lipstick.
2. Choose the loose shirt with jeans for a more casual look.

Her apartment was small but cozy. A narrow hallway led to the living room, which at night turned into a bedroom. There was a comfortable couch covered with decorative pillows, a bookshelf with randomly arranged volumes, and a small desk by the window, where a desk lamp cast a soft, warm glow. The bathroom was small but tidy, with a mirror above the sink and a shelf filled with bottles of cosmetics. The kitchen, located in the far corner of the apartment near the balcony, was adorned with string lights, creating a dim, almost magical atmosphere.

She approached the console table in the hallway, where a large mirror in a black frame hung. It was positioned so that a small part of it could be seen from the kitchen. She ran her hand across its surface as if trying to catch the reflection of her thoughts and looked at herself.

Finishing with her outfit, she moved on to her hair. Should she curl it for extra volume or leave it straight, fixing it lightly with hairspray? On the table in her room, there were:

* Hairspray (left on the console table in front of the mirror)
* A small mirror (lying next to the hairspray)

**Key moment:**

1. Take the hairspray and fix her hairstyle.
2. Take the small mirror and put it in her bag.

Running her fingers through her hair, she checked her appearance one last time.

A message alert sounded on her phone. It was from her boyfriend: *"Are you getting ready? I can't wait to see you."*

Something in the message made her feel slightly uneasy. Was there too much eagerness in it? She decides...

**Key moment:**

1. Reply: "Yes, I'll be there soon!" and continue getting ready.
2. Not reply immediately, pretending to be busy.

Final touches: choosing a perfume, checking her bag, glancing in the mirror. Was everything in order? The clock showed 19:30. Time to leave. But something inside her whispered that this evening would not be easy... (Anxiety: 15%)

**Chapter 2. The Party**

Music pulsed through the house, its rhythm vibrating in the walls. The living room was dimly lit, with colorful LED lights casting flickering reflections on the furniture. Laughter and voices blended into one, filling the space with a warm yet chaotic atmosphere. The party was in full swing.

I stepped inside, scanning the room for familiar faces. My best friend, Becky, was already there, chatting animatedly with a group of people. As soon as she saw me, she rushed over and hugged me with exaggerated enthusiasm.

"Finally! You're here!" she exclaimed, pulling back to examine me. "You look great. How was your day? Still seeing weird things?"

I tensed. The question was too direct, too intrusive. She never used to care about that.

I forced a small smile. "I'm fine. And no, not really."

"Great!" Becky beamed too widely and handed me a cup of punch. "You have to try this! Everyone says it’s amazing."

**Key moment:**

1. Take the cup and drink a few small sips.
2. Politely refuse.

**(I reluctantly took the cup and drank a few small sips.)**

(I politely refused, saying I didn’t want any punch.) Becky leaned in closer and continued:

"You should keep drawing those strange creatures you see. It’s so fascinating!"

A cold shiver ran down my spine. Was she saying this loudly on purpose? People nearby glanced at us with subtle curiosity.

(Why is she doing this? She never acted this way before.)

The conversation shifted, but the discomfort remained. Becky bounced between harmless, casual questions and ones that cut a little too deep.

"How’s your relationship going? Still as mysterious as ever?" she asked, her eyes glinting.

"We’re fine," I replied shortly, not wanting to go into details.

Becky hummed thoughtfully. "Interesting. You don’t sound very convincing."

I didn’t get a chance to reply—using the excuse of grabbing a soda, I headed toward the kitchen. As I walked through the hallway, I spotted Jack, my ex, in one of the quieter rooms. Our eyes met briefly, and I gave him a small nod.

"Hey," he said neutrally.

"Hey," I replied dryly.

(This is so uncomfortable. Hopefully, I won’t have to interact with him for the rest of the night.)

I immediately recalled our last meeting. That moment when I told him we should break up. I saw how his eyes filled with pain, how he tried to say something, but I had already turned and walked away. I had thought it was the right decision at the time. But now, facing him again, I felt a strange heaviness inside. Maybe I had been too harsh.

Stepping into the kitchen, I spotted my current boyfriend. Feeling a wave of warmth, I walked over and wrapped my arms around him.

"Hey, Tom, I missed you," I whispered, looking up at him.

But instead of returning my affection, his embrace was stiff, distant.

"Hey," he replied coolly.

"Is everything okay?" I asked, searching his face.

"Yeah. Just… tired."

(Why is he acting so cold? He never used to be like this.)

To break the awkwardness, Jack—who was standing nearby—popped open a can of cola and took a sip. Then, almost absentmindedly, he handed another one to me.

**Key moment:**

1. Accept the cola and take a sip.
2. Politely refuse.

The night went on. I laughed, talked with different people, and tried to fully engage in the party’s atmosphere. But every now and then, I caught Tom watching me. He didn’t look amused or happy—he seemed distant, calculating. His gaze was particularly intense when I chatted easily and playfully with the guys.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. A message.

*"Hey, I forgot to give you something. I’m outside."*

It was an old classmate. I excused myself and stepped outside, inhaling the cool night air. He was waiting near the sidewalk, smiling as I approached.

"Long time no see!" he said warmly, giving me a brief hug.

"Yeah, it’s been ages!" I laughed. "What did you want to give me?"

We talked for a bit before he handed me a small item—something I had lent him a long time ago and completely forgotten about. As we spoke, I couldn’t shake the eerie feeling that someone was watching us. Glancing up, I noticed a shadow in the window overlooking the street.

(Is someone watching us?)

My classmate waved goodbye and left. I lingered for a moment, feeling a growing sense of unease. Maybe it was time to go home.

**Key moment:**

1. Text Tom that I’m leaving.
2. Go back inside and say goodbye to everyone, including him.

However, something inside told me that the decisions I made tonight would have a far greater impact than I realized.
